<h2>My thought process</h2>

<ul>
  <li>~ I wanted something fun to do to pass time during school</li>
  <li>~ I wanted it to be fast, so i used Cloudflare for its speed & security (also cause their insights are awesome)</li>
  <li>~ Used Google's Firebase to store the chat portion, with realtime database: for speed and its easy-to-setup process</li>
  <li>~ just had fun with it, and was open to suggestions to improve it and add new features =3</li>
</ul>
